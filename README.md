# 🌍 WordQuest

**Explore, play, and learn new words every day!** 🎮✨

WordQuest is a fun, interactive web app designed to help children ages 5-10 discover vocabulary through themed adventures! Kids explore magical worlds (like Jungle, Space, and Food Town) while learning new words through playful, game-like activities.

## 🎯 What is WordQuest?
