# 🌍 WordyWorld - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 📚 What is WordyWorld?

Picture this: You know how kids love exploring video games and going on adventures? Well, WordyWorld is like that... but instead of fighting monsters, kids become **Word Explorers** who discover cool new words while having a blast! 🎮✨

Think of it like a magical theme park, but each "ride" (world) teaches you awesome words! 🎢

## 🎯 The Big Goal (Why We're Building This!)

Kids spend lots of time watching videos (we're looking at you, YouTube! 😄). We want to flip that script and make learning as fun as watching cartoons!

**Our Mission**: Help kids build super strong vocabularies through playful adventures that make them go "WOW, learning is cool!" instead of "This is boring, turn on the TV." 📺
